# Clothing e-Commerce App
This project is a full-stack e-commerce web application for a fictional clothing brand, 
built with the MERN stack. It allows users (guests or registered) to browse products, 
filter/search, add items to a cart, checkout, and receive order confirmation emails. 
On the backend, it uses secure user authentication (JWT) and persists data in MongoDB via Mongoose.
